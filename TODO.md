### Warnings
- [ ] `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence` in `jieba` and `material` plugins.
- [ ] `DeprecationWarning: Setting a fallback anchor function is deprecated`.
- [ ] `Excluding 'README.md' from the site because it conflicts with 'index.md'.`
- [ ] Pages exist in `docs` but are not included in `nav` configuration (e.g., `404.md`, `advanced.md`, `applications.md`, etc.).
- [ ] References in `nav` configuration not found in documentation files (e.g., `applications/search-engines.md`, `reference/configuration.md`, etc.).
- [ ] Doc file links to targets not found among documentation files (e.g., `index.md` links to `contributing/guidelines.md`, `basic-usage.md` links to `advanced-features.md`).
- [ ] Doc files contain unrecognized relative links (multiple occurrences in `404.md`, `advanced.md`, `applications.md`, `implementation.md`, `interactive.md`, `performance.md`, `family/index.md`, `theory/index.md`).
- [ ] Doc file `reference/benchmarks.md` contains an absolute link.
- [ ] Investigate and resolve `SyntaxWarning` and `DeprecationWarning` messages during build.
- [ ] Address `README.md` conflict with `index.md`.
- [ ] Ensure all relevant pages are included in the `nav` configuration.
- [ ] Fix all broken and unrecognized links in documentation files.
