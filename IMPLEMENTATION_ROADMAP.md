# Implementation Roadmap: Cross-Repository Coordination for uubed Project

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive implementation roadmap for establishing cross-repository coordination in the uubed project. Based on extensive research of GitHub Actions best practices and multi-repository CI/CD patterns, this roadmap outlines the specific steps needed to implement the coordination improvements outlined in section 3.3 of the PLAN.md.

## 🎯 Implementation Goals

The implementation addresses three key requirements from PLAN.md section 3.3:

1. **GitHub Actions that trigger downstream builds** in docs, py, and rs repositories
2. **Release tagging policy** that bumps versions in the order **rs → py → docs**
3. **Nightly benchmark job** to catch performance regressions across languages

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before beginning implementation, ensure:

- [ ] Administrative access to all three repositories (uubed-rs, uubed-py, uubed-docs)
- [ ] Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope for cross-repository triggers
- [ ] PyPI account and API token for Python package publishing
- [ ] Understanding of each repository's current CI/CD setup

## 🚀 Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)
**Focus**: Establish basic cross-repository communication

## 🔄 Workflow Orchestration

### Standard Development Flow

1. **Developer pushes to uubed-rs**
   - Rust tests and benchmarks run
   - On success, triggers uubed-py workflow
   - Performance comparison results stored

2. **uubed-py workflow triggered**
   - Python bindings updated with latest Rust version
   - Integration tests run
   - On success, triggers uubed-docs workflow
