TLDR: This section is your hands-on playground for QuadB64! Dive into interactive demos, calculators, and visualizers to truly grasp how position-safe encoding works, how it performs, and how it solves real-world data problems. It's learning by doing, but with more digital magic.

# Interactive Tools & Demos

Imagine you're a curious explorer, and this section is your interactive map to the hidden treasures of QuadB64. Each tool is a unique lens, allowing you to zoom in on specific concepts, manipulate data, and witness the power of position-safe encoding in action.

Imagine you're a budding engineer, and this section is your personal workshop. You can tinker with encoding parameters, run simulations, and visualize the impact of your choices, gaining practical insights that theoretical explanations alone can't provide.

Explore QuadB64 encodings through interactive tools, demos, and visualizations that help you understand the concepts hands-on.

## Available Tools

- **[Encoding Playground](encoding-playground/)** - Try different encodings with your own data
- **[Encoder Demo](encoder-demo/)** - Step-by-step encoding visualization  
- **[Similarity Visualizer](similarity-visualizer/)** - Compare similarity preservation across encodings
- **[Performance Calculator](performance-calculator/)** - Estimate performance for your use case
- **[Comparison Tables](comparison-tables/)** - Side-by-side feature comparisons

## Learning Through Interaction

These tools are designed to help you:

- **Experiment** with different encoding schemes
- **Visualize** how position safety works
- **Compare** performance characteristics
- **Understand** trade-offs between different approaches
