# Interactive Tools & Demos

Explore QuadB64 encodings through interactive tools, demos, and visualizations that help you understand the concepts hands-on.

## Available Tools

- **[Encoding Playground](encoding-playground/)** - Try different encodings with your own data
- **[Encoder Demo](encoder-demo/)** - Step-by-step encoding visualization  
- **[Similarity Visualizer](similarity-visualizer/)** - Compare similarity preservation across encodings
- **[Performance Calculator](performance-calculator/)** - Estimate performance for your use case
- **[Comparison Tables](comparison-tables/)** - Side-by-side feature comparisons

## Learning Through Interaction

These tools are designed to help you:

- **Experiment** with different encoding schemes
- **Visualize** how position safety works
- **Compare** performance characteristics
- **Understand** trade-offs between different approaches
- **Plan** implementations for your specific needs

Whether you're learning the concepts or planning a production deployment, these interactive tools provide immediate feedback and insight into QuadB64's behavior.
