> This page is all about how fast QuadB64 is! We show you that even with its fancy position-safe features, it's almost as quick as regular Base64, and sometimes even faster, especially when your computer has special speed-boosting hardware.

# Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

QuadB64 encodings are designed to maintain high performance while providing position safety. Our benchmarks show that the overhead compared to standard Base64 is minimal, especially with SIMD optimizations enabled.

## Benchmark Methodology

All benchmarks were conducted using:
- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 32GB RAM
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: Rust 1.75.0 with `--release` optimizations
- **Data**: Random binary data of various sizes
- **Iterations**: 1000 runs per test, median reported

## Running Your Own Benchmarks

To run benchmarks on your system:

```bash
# Install with benchmarking features
pip install uubed[bench]

# Run the benchmark suite
python -m uubed.benchmark

# Run specific encoding benchmarks
python -m uubed.benchmark --encoding eq64 --sizes 1k,1m,100m
```

## Optimization Tips

1. **Enable SIMD**: Ensure your CPU supports SIMD instructions
2. **Use Native Extensions**: Install the Rust-based native extensions
3. **Batch Processing**: Process data in chunks for better cache utilization
4. **Platform Tuning**: See our [Platform Tuning Guide](/performance/platform-tuning) for detailed optimization strategies
