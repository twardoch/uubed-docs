# Theory & Concepts

This section covers the mathematical and theoretical foundations behind QuadB64 encoding schemes. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or simply curious about the "why" behind position-safe encoding, you'll find comprehensive explanations here.

## What You'll Learn

- **The Substring Pollution Problem**: How traditional Base64 creates issues in modern search systems
- **Position-Safe Encoding Theory**: Mathematical principles behind QuadB64
- **Information Theory**: Encoding efficiency and theoretical limits
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world scenarios where theory meets implementation

## Chapters

1. **[Introduction](introduction/)** - The substring pollution problem and why it matters
2. **[QuadB64 Fundamentals](fundamentals/)** - Core mathematical principles
3. **[Base64 Evolution](evolution/)** - Historical context and improvements
4. **[Locality Preservation](locality/)** - Spatial and semantic locality in encodings
5. **[Visual Diagrams](diagrams/)** - Graphical representations of concepts

Whether you're implementing QuadB64 in production or conducting research, understanding these theoretical foundations will help you make informed decisions about which encoding scheme best fits your needs.
