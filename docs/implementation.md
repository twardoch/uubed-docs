# Implementation Guide

This section covers the technical implementation details of the QuadB64 library, from high-level architecture to low-level optimizations.

## In This Section

- **[Architecture](architecture/)** - System architecture and design principles
- **[Native Extensions](native-extensions/)** - High-performance Rust implementations
- **[Advanced Features](advanced-features/)** - Advanced functionality and customization

## Implementation Overview

The UUBED library provides multiple implementation layers:

- **Python Interface**: High-level, Pythonic API for ease of use
- **Rust Core**: High-performance native implementations with SIMD support
- **C Extensions**: Low-level bindings for maximum performance
- **WebAssembly**: Browser-compatible implementations

Whether you're integrating QuadB64 into existing systems or building new applications, this section provides the technical depth you need for successful implementation.
