# Applications & Use Cases

Discover how QuadB64 encodings are being used across different industries and domains to solve real-world problems.

## In This Section

- **[Overview](overview/)** - Common use cases and application patterns
- **[Industry Examples](industries/)** - Sector-specific implementations
- **[Case Studies](case-studies/)** - Detailed implementation stories

## Application Domains

QuadB64 encodings find applications in:

- **Search Engines**: Preventing substring pollution in large-scale indexing
- **Vector Databases**: Maintaining locality in high-dimensional embeddings
- **AI/ML Systems**: Safe encoding of model parameters and embeddings
- **Geospatial Systems**: Spatial indexing with locality preservation
- **Security Applications**: Position-aware encoding for data protection
- **Data Analytics**: Clean encoding for substring-based analysis

Each application leverages different aspects of QuadB64's position-safe properties to solve specific challenges in data representation and search.
