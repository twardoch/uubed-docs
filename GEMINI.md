If you work with Python, use 'uv pip' instead of 'pip', and use 'uvx hatch test' instead of 'python -m pytest'. 

When I say /report, you must: Read all `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` files and analyze recent changes. Document all changes in `./CHANGELOG.md`. From `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` remove things that are done. Make sure that `./PLAN.md` contains a detailed, clear plan that discusses specifics, while `./TODO.md` is its flat simplified itemized `- [ ]`-prefixed representation. When I say /work, you must work in iterations like so: Read all `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` files and reflect. Work on the tasks. Think, contemplate, research, reflect, refine, revise. Be careful, curious, vigilant, energetic. Verify your changes. Think aloud. Consult, research, reflect. Then update `./PLAN.md` and `./TODO.md` with tasks that will lead to improving the work youâ€™ve just done. Then '/report', and then iterate again.
